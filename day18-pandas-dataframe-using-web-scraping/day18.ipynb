Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with \"how to work online\" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20\" style=\"font-weight:800;\">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.\n",

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

The Risk Labs team, operates as one cohesive (amazing!) culture, but focuses on two core protocols, UMA and Across. UMA and Across are decentralized protocols governed by community members across the globe in DAOs, and are supported by Risk Labs Foundation. UMA's optimistic oracle (OO) can record any verifiable truth or data onto a blockchain. Across is leading the future of interoperability with its frontier intents based architecture.¬†  \\n\\n\\nWe‚Äôre looking for a Jr. Smart Contract Engineer to join the Across protocol team. You‚Äôd be working alongside top tier engineering talent, world class data driven product development, and a team motivated to be hugely impactful for the exciting interoperable future that we‚Äôre racing towards. You‚Äôre a person who loves optimizing and building at the intersection of technology, finance, and data.\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n* Protocol architecture: Design and build protocol upgrades from idea to deployment.\\n* Smart contracts: Implement designs with a focus on security, simplicity, ease of use, and gas-efficiency.\\n* Code review and mentorship: Write code in a highly collaborative open source ecosystem. In depth reviews of others‚Äô contributions is expected with a focus on helping others grow their technical expertise.\\n* Bots: write complimentary offchain code to interact with the protocol. Bots should have a high degree of correctness, efficiency, and anti-fragility\\n* These responsibilities are going to be similar to the Sr. Smart Contract role posted; however, as a junior engineer, we have lower expectations about your previous experience. That doesn‚Äôt mean our expectations are low, instead we have higher expectations for the demonstrable and uncanny ability to learn and apply new concepts quickly. Someone who is exceptionally keen to learn and invest their time with us, in exchange for us investing in their growth. Someone who we hire for this role will become proficient in the above categories.\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirements\\n* 2+ years of experience in engineering at a software organization. This can include multiple internships, what we want to see is your familiarity with engineering best practices (sprints, code review, etc.) and a level of professionalism.\\n* 1+ years of working with blockchain-based projects (think hackathons or personal projects as well), and a deep passion for blockchain technology, cryptoeconomic protocol design, game theory, or decentralized finance\\n* Outstanding critical thinking skills; low ego, high curiosity and comfort in being wrong\\n* A love for great software; desire to understand the why and the how of everything you work on\\n* Demonstrated ability to apply existing skills to new technologies\\n* Growth mindset; a desire to learn from and mentor those around you\\n* Strong communication and collaboration skills, especially written\\n\\n\\n\\nCompensation and Benefits\\n* Pay packages include competitive salaries &amp; meaningful token options.\\n* Salaries for this role range from $100-200k (USD), and your token allocation can grow with your voting rewards while you participate in the growing ecosystem.\\n* Will pay in stablecoins or fiat\\n* Philosophies for a culture that show we care: Take vacation when you need it, family care, training and development (just to name a few)\\n* 100% remote, which means we encourage you to create the work environment that you thrive in\\n* We are a globally distributed team and require all employees to have at least 3-4 hours of daily overlap with Eastern Standard Time (EST) to ensure seamless collaboration and communication. This allows us to work effectively across time zones while maintaining a strong team connection.\\n* At least two team wide offsite trips a year\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudies have shown that women and people of colour are less likely to apply to jobs unless they meet every single qualification. Risk Labs, the employing entity, is an equal opportunity employer and is dedicated to diverse, inclusive, and authentic workplaces. So,¬† if you‚Äôre excited about this role but your past experience doesn‚Äôt perfectly align- we encourage you to apply anyways. We value you taking the chance. Risk labs will not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\\n\\n\\nOur values:¬†\\n1) We value each individual‚Äôs right to economic freedom.\\n2) We value openness, honesty, and directness.\\n3) We value integrity.\\n4) We value iterative learning.\\n5) We value taking smart risks.\\n6) We value creating an environment where everyone ‚Äúdoes their best work‚Äù.\\n\\n\\nWhy do we love working at Risk Labs?\\n\\n\\nWe are a group that's aligned with the ethos of the crypto industry and doing our best to make an impact for the industry and world at large.

We‚Äôve built a solid foundation, in terms of the team, the technology, and the products, and the road map ahead is one full of exciting technical challenges, growth, and telling our story to the world.¬†Across is creating an interoperable world where DeFi is seamless with its intents based architecture. We‚Äôve grown from an early bridge, to a market leader, and won‚Äôt stop innovating and building. We have big dreams, and a team excited to bring them to life.¬†\\n\\n\\nStill want to know more?\\n\\n\\n- Our team blends a mix of highly-sought engineers, and a diverse business team to showcase their high quality tech.

Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with \"how to work online\" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

       "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with \"how to work online\" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

       "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with \"how to work online\" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20\" style=\"font-weight:800;\">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

       "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with \"how to work online\" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20\" style=\"font-weight:800;\">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.

       "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with \"how to work online\" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20\" style=\"font-weight:800;\">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site.
